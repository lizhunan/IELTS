### A polluted place

- release waste water 排放废水
- emit fumes 排放废气

Ok, I'm going to talk about a place affected by pollution.
It is a town called Qingzhou, about 1 hours' drive from my hometown.
About 10 years ago, when I first visited to the town, the sky was blue, the river was clear and air was fresh.
But my friends and I visited the town recently, we found pollution wes serious there.
Now the whole town is smoggy（烟雾弥漫的） all the year round, the river water becomes dark and the air is smelly（有臭味的）.
We were disappointed and later we got know the reason why the place is polluted.
In recent years, there are many industiral districts emerging in Qingzhou. For example, some chemical factories release waste water into the river and emit fumes into the air.
Local government focuses on economic deveopment rather than environmental protection. 
I hope that the authorities could stop developing economy at the cost of environment.

## 10.23 

### Foreign country

Well, the country I’d like to talk about is the UK. 
I first knew the country when I was very young at primary school. At that time, I read a fantasy book—called Harry Potter. 
For me, that book is literally an encyclopedia of British culture. So you can see books are important source for people to learn about different cultures. 
Besides, we can also refer to movies and documentaries to know more about the customs. For food culture, I’m interested in gingerbread which is a typical British food. I got to know it from HP. Finally I had a taste of it in college and it was very delicious. 
When it comes to the difference from Chinese culture, I would like to talk about dragon. In China, dragon means auspiciousness / power and good luck, but in British culture, dragon is an evil creature. 
As for the reason why I want to know more about the UK, that’s because the book HP inspires my imagination of British culture. 
Besides, I’m fond of delicious food and I want to try the snacks in the UK.

My experience of wasting time is that when I prepared IELTS, I wasted much time.
It was June this year that I had much free time. Instead of making full use of the time to study English, I went to parties and travelled to different cities for 1 month, such as GZ, SZ, and CD. After the blast, I came back to Jinan and was going to work on the IELTS test. But my university informed me to take part in a competition in the field of computer science. Then my team member and I prepared the match for almost two months, during which I had no time to learn English. That means that I had to postpone my English learning to September. I was really regretful because I realized that leaning English requires much time and energy but I wasted so much time in the past three months, especially the partying and travelling, which wasted me 1 month. This experience also teaches me a lesson that I should make full use of time and make a clear plan.

OK, this topic reminds me of something happened when I was in the third year of my university. It was a mid-term project that we were required to finish. There were several subjects for us to choose, among which the most difficult one was “face recognition”.  All our classmates avoided this subject. But I had the urge to have a try because if I could succeed in it, it would improve my credits and rank greatly. Then, I chose to take the risk. In the following three weeks, I collected data, made models, programmed the codes and did experiment in the lab. Finally, my subject was successful and got a high score. My credits and rank rose accordingly. This experience taught me a lesson that high risk can bring about more profits. Though at first it was a challenge and risk for me, I harvested good grades. Of course, hard work is always worthwhile and my efforts helped me achieve my goal.

This topic reminds me of / I am going to take about a time when I got lost in my childhood. At that time, I was about three years old. My mother and I went to the shopping mall. At the entrance of the mall, there was a beautiful fountain. I became very interested in the fountain. I used to wait quietly by the side of the fitting room when my mother tried on a dress in a clothes store. But that day, I sneaked out when my mom was in the fitting room and went to the fountain. I played with the water for a while before coming back to my mom. But I was kind of lost. Looking through every shop for several times, I didn’t find my mom. Actually, I just couldn’t remember which shop my mom was in. being scared and anxious, I went to the shop assistant for help. Thanks to the nice lady, she helped me look for my mom by means of the broadcasting system. Finally, my mom went to the staff office and picked me up. That was the only time when I got lost. Since then, I have never got lost.
