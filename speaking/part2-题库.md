### A polluted place

- release waste water 排放废水
- emit fumes 排放废气

Ok, I'm going to talk about a place affected by pollution.
It is a town called Qingzhou, about 1 hours' drive from my hometown.
About 10 years ago, when I first visited to the town, the sky was blue, the river was clear and air was fresh.
But my friends and I visited the town recently, we found pollution wes serious there.
Now the whole town is smoggy（烟雾弥漫的） all the year round, the river water becomes dark and the air is smelly（有臭味的）.
We were disappointed and later we got know the reason why the place is polluted.
In recent years, there are many industiral districts emerging in Qingzhou. For example, some chemical factories release waste water into the river and emit fumes into the air.
Local government focuses on economic deveopment rather than environmental protection. 
I hope that the authorities could stop developing economy at the cost of environment.

### Foreign country

Well, the country I’d like to talk about is the UK. 
I first knew the country when I was very young at primary school. At that time, I read a fantasy book—called Harry Potter. 
For me, that book is literally an encyclopedia of British culture. So you can see books are important source for people to learn about different cultures. 
Besides, we can also refer to movies and documentaries to know more about the customs. For food culture, I’m interested in gingerbread which is a typical British food. I got to know it from HP. Finally I had a taste of it in college and it was very delicious. 
When it comes to the difference from Chinese culture, I would like to talk about dragon. In China, dragon means auspiciousness / power and good luck, but in British culture, dragon is an evil creature. 
As for the reason why I want to know more about the UK, that’s because the book HP inspires my imagination of British culture. 
Besides, I’m fond of delicious food and I want to try the snacks in the UK.

We were very excited, though we had participated in many competitions and won the prizes on behalf of our hometown, because that competition had the largest scale and it was really challenging to win. 
That day, all the members in our team wore a white T-shirt. The design was simple with only the logo of our team on the chest. The logo was a cute robot in the color of green.

My friend and I took a self-drive tour to Qingzhou last spring. QZ简介。 It was a three-hour trip and we set off at 8 am. When we drove northward, the views became pretty beautiful. There were many rolling hills and clear water. There was even a small waterfall at the foot of a mountain. The most impressive thing during the trip was that we drove uphill when arriving at the famous mountain. When being tired, we stopped by the roads and took some photos of the pretty views. Another thing I have to mention is that we got to know many people we also took a self-drive tour to QZ from different cities. We had a picnic together at noon and took some pictures. I was really happy that day because of friend’s company and the eye-pleasing sceneries.
