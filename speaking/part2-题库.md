Walking into the street, the ancient buildings come into sight. The red walls, blue tiles, flying angles and the wooden door show the charm of the historical place. 
My friend and I sometimes go there to enjoy the busy atmosphere with other tourists. 
There are many gift shops and refreshments stands selling meal pie, the most famous snack in this city.

### A polluted place

- release waste water 排放废水
- emit fumes 排放废气

Ok, I'm going to talk about a place affected by pollution.
It is a town called Qingzhou, about 1 hours' drive from my hometown.
About 10 years ago, when I first visited to the town, the sky was blue, the river was clear and air was fresh.
But my friends and I visited the town recently, we found pollution wes serious there.
Now the whole town is smoggy（烟雾弥漫的） all the year round, the river water becomes dark and the air is smelly（有臭味的）.
We were disappointed and later we got know the reason why the place is polluted.
In recent years, there are many industiral districts emerging in Qingzhou. For example, some chemical factories release waste water into the river and emit fumes into the air.
Local government focuses on economic deveopment rather than environmental protection. 
I hope that the authorities could stop developing economy at the cost of environment.

### Foreign country

Well, the country I’d like to talk about is the UK. 
I first knew the country when I was very young at primary school. At that time, I read a fantasy book—called Harry Potter. 
For me, that book is literally an encyclopedia of British culture. So you can see books are important source for people to learn about different cultures. 
Besides, we can also refer to movies and documentaries to know more about the customs. For food culture, I’m interested in gingerbread which is a typical British food. I got to know it from HP. Finally I had a taste of it in college and it was very delicious. 
When it comes to the difference from Chinese culture, I would like to talk about dragon. In China, dragon means auspiciousness / power and good luck, but in British culture, dragon is an evil creature. 
As for the reason why I want to know more about the UK, that’s because the book HP inspires my imagination of British culture. 
Besides, I’m fond of delicious food and I want to try the snacks in the UK.
