### A polluted place

- release waste water 排放废水
- emit fumes 排放废气

Ok, I'm going to talk about a place affected by pollution.
It is a town called Qingzhou, about 1 hours' drive from my hometown.
About 10 years ago, when I first visited to the town, the sky was blue, the river was clear and air was fresh.
But my friends and I visited the town recently, we found pollution wes serious there.
Now the whole town is smoggy（烟雾弥漫的） all the year round, the river water becomes dark and the air is smelly（有臭味的）.
We were disappointed and later we got know the reason why the place is polluted.
In recent years, there are many industiral districts emerging in Qingzhou. For example, some chemical factories release waste water into the river and emit fumes into the air.
Local government focuses on economic deveopment rather than environmental protection. 
I hope that the authorities could stop developing economy at the cost of environment.
