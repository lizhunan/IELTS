And how you feel about it

>Well, I have plenty of applications, among them I would like to talk about taobao, which I downloaded 3 years ago when I bought my first phone.
It is an application designed for online purchasing. Taobao is popular among users of all ages with around 300 million users. And it was downloaded more than 900 million times.
It was few years ago that I firstly used taobao, I found it is much more convenient than shopping in stores, since then, using taobao to shop online has become a kind of habit for me. I used taobao more and more frequently.
The main/primary reason I use taobao frequently is that it provides me more choices so that I can choose the products with the best quality among a range of selections. On top of that, things bought online is less pricey so I can get a better service with less money. The service of the delivery is very good. You can get everything you want without getting out of the door. More importantly, it can help you to save time and energy to focus on other activities.
It is really hard to say my feelings on using this app. When I add the things to my cart, I feel extremely excited. But when I see the balance on my account, I feel a bit regretful.
