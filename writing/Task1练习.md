While this item merely made up 15.77%, 16.36% and 18.8% in Sweden, Italy and Spain respectively in 2002.（相信作者也发现，这一段里面需要反复出现foods, drinks and tobacco，十分冗杂，因此来说直接开头的时候As for food, drinks and tobacco consumption, Turkey appeared to be the largest, which … . Similarly, a 28.91% was seen in Ireland, while Sweden, Italy and Spain witnessed a 15.77% … respectively.）

>By Contrast, the percentage of the cost of clothing and footwear was the largest in Italy, which occupied（这里变换一下，… occupying 9% …） 9% in 2002.

Second was Sweden, showing a 3.22%, which is similar to that of Italy with 3.2%. In comparison, Spain and Ireland was witnessed to have a smaller percentage, having 1.98% and 2.21% each.）

>To sum up, consumer spend more on food, drinks and tobacco in Turkey in 2002 among the five countries. In Sweden, people spend less on clothing and footwear.（结尾段毫无意义，陈述了原文中说过的东西，毫无新意，最后一段是没有意义的）

- 表现较好的方面	文章中不错的进行了论述
- 有待改善的方面	文中的句型有待提高，文中的一系列句子十分重复，结尾也毫无作用，需要一步步提升。有待提高。

- 审题：
此题为曲线图，是关于1979到2004年期间某欧洲国家在鱼，羊肉，牛肉和鸡肉的消费情况。纵轴为每人每周的消费量，以克为单位。横轴为时间。

- 写作思路：
曲线图相对来说属于难度不是很大的题型。应该先根据横轴分析变化，然后再进行比较，描述变化的时候要注意归类，也就是把增长的归为一类，减少的归为另一类。同样都是增长或者减少的，则应该根据变化的幅度，从大到小排列。
