### 批改后

> The table indicates how the consuption（应该是consumption） of three different items occupied in five different countries in 2002.

>The percentage of the consuption of food, drinks and tobacco in Turkey was the largest, which occupied（这里面用accounted for） 32.14% in 2002. Similarly, the food, drinks and tobacco took up 28.91% in Ireland. While this item merely made up 15.77%, 16.36% and 18.8% in Sweden, Italy and Spain respectively in 2002.（相信作者也发现，这一段里面需要反复出现foods, drinks and tobacco，十分冗杂，因此来说直接开头的时候As for food, drinks and tobacco consumption, Turkey appeared to be the largest, which … . Similarly, a 28.91% was seen in Ireland, while Sweden, Italy and Spain witnessed a 15.77% … respectively.）

>By Contrast, the percentage of the cost of clothing and footwear was the largest in Italy, which occupied（这里变换一下，… occupying 9% …） 9% in 2002. Compared with consumption of Italian, the percentage of expenditure of clothing and footwear was the smallest in Sweden with 5.4%. And（and一般不用再句子开头，这里面用Furthermore） this item account for 6.43%, 6.51% and 6.63% in Ireland, Spain and Turkey respectively. The percentage of the expenditure of leisure and education was the largest in Turkey at 4.35%. In Sweden, leisure and education occupied 3.22%. Similarly, the percentage of this item was 3.2% in Italy in 2002. Leisure and education account for 1.98% and 2.21% in Spain and Ireland.（其实这里面完全可以不用重复leisure and education，完全可以是For the expenditure in leisure and education, Turkey ranked the first with 4.35%. Second was Sweden, showing a 3.22%, which is similar to that of Italy with 3.2%. In comparison, Spain and Ireland was witnessed to have a smaller percentage, having 1.98% and 2.21% each.）

>To sum up, consumer spend more on food, drinks and tobacco in Turkey in 2002 among the five countries. In Sweden, people spend less on clothing and footwear.（结尾段毫无意义，陈述了原文中说过的东西，毫无新意，最后一段是没有意义的）

- 表现较好的方面	文章中不错的进行了论述
- 有待改善的方面	文中的句型有待提高，文中的一系列句子十分重复，结尾也毫无作用，需要一步步提升。有待提高。

### 范文

>The information given by the table is about the proportion of buyer expenditure on different items in five different nations in 2002.

>As can be seen from the table, in the five nations, most of consumer expenditure went into food, drinks and tobacco. The percentage of the item in Turkey was the highest (32.14%). It was followed by Ireland (28.91%), while that of Italy, Spain and Sweden accounted for around 16% respectively, twice as little as that of Turkey. Clothing and footwear was the second most popular spending item. In Italy, its consumers had 9% cost for the item, while that in other countries only took up less than 7%. In contrast, expenditure on leisure and education had the smallest percentage, taking up 4.35% in Turkey, about four times higher than that in Spain and doubled that in Ireland.

>Italy's consumers and Sweden's buyers alike had 3.2% cost for this item.

>In conclusion, based on what have been analyzed above, it is clear that although consumers in different country had different spending habits, food, drink and tobacco was always the most important buying item in 2002.

- 审题：
此题为表格题，是关于2002年五个国家在不同消费品上的开支。表格纵列为五个不同国家，分别是爱尔兰，意大利，西班牙，和土耳其；横列为三类不同的消费品，分别为食物/饮料/香烟，服装/鞋子，休闲/教育。数据形式为百分比。

- 写作思路：
表格题的写作思路的关键首先在于分析横、纵列，然后得出写作的顺序。分析的重点在于动态的变化和静态的比较。本题为固定时间段内的比较，不涉及动态变化。在静态比较方面，有两个思路：是每个国家在不同消费品上的开支的比较；二是不同国家在同一消费品上的开支的比较。从两个思路中的任意一个切入，都可以描述出表格的核心信息。

### 范文

>The graph illustrates changes in the amounts of beef, lamb, chicken and fish consumed in a particular European country between 1979 and 2004.

>In 1979 beef was by far the most popular of these foods, with about 225 grams consumed per person per week. Lamb and chicken were eaten in similar quantities (around 150 grams), while much less fish was consumed (Just over 50 grams ).

>However, during this 25-year period the consumption of beef and lamb fell dramatically to approximately 100 grams and 55 grams respectively. The consumption of fish also declined, but much less significantly to just below 50 grams, so although it remained the least popular food, consumption levels were the most stable.

>The consumption of chicken, on the other hand, showed an upward trend, overtaking that of lamb in 1980 and that of beef in 1989. By 2004 it had soared to almost 250 grams per person per week.

- 审题：
此题为曲线图，是关于1979到2004年期间某欧洲国家在鱼，羊肉，牛肉和鸡肉的消费情况。纵轴为每人每周的消费量，以克为单位。横轴为时间。

- 写作思路：
曲线图相对来说属于难度不是很大的题型。应该先根据横轴分析变化，然后再进行比较，描述变化的时候要注意归类，也就是把增长的归为一类，减少的归为另一类。同样都是增长或者减少的，则应该根据变化的幅度，从大到小排列。
