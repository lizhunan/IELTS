2. 题目改写
3. **个人观点**

### 背景介绍

###  分论点－主体段论证方法

- 因果论证（重要，难写）
- 举例论证
- 对比论证

#### 因果论证

- 例题：
    1. 大众传媒(mass media)发展：电视、广播、互联网--A
    2. 广告无处不在，每时每刻都可以听到--B
    3. 被广告洗脑(be brainwashed)--C
    4. 冲动消费(impulsive consumption)，买了不需要的东西--D
- 表示“原因”的逻辑连接词
    - because of/ due to/ owing to/ as a result of + 名词
    - because/ since/ as + 句子
- 表示“结果”的逻辑连接词
    - as a result/ therefore/ hence/ thus/ consequently/ as a consequence + 句子
    - a result in/ contribute to/ lead to + 名词 **如果要加动作，需要doing形式**

- 易错：
    - 因果颠倒
    - 有因无果。必须得出结果，论述的最后一个环节：点题的论证
    - **逻辑链缺失**
- 范文
    >**Due** to the development of mass media such as TV, broadcast and the Internet, there are many ads everywhere, **so** people can hear and see them at any time. **Therefore**, people who are exposed to ads may be attracted and even be brainwashed, **which leads to** impulsive consumption, which means that products they have bought are not the real needs of them even the society. 

#### 举例论证

    - ...., like + 名词/名词性词组
- 举例论证的使用场景
    - 题干中出现明显的例子，比如出现like,such as

    - 出现best,only等绝对词

#### 对比论证

- 时间对比
- 假设对比
- 与反面事物对比

作业：
主体段1：
保护动物没有获得足够的关注
没有获取足够的关注-人们没有足够的保护意识-有人仍然购买动物制品-大量捕杀野生动物
主体段2：
相比较以前，对野生动物的关注度有所提高-人们对野生动物的保护在一定程度上有所提高-捕杀动物的数量在减少

Nowadays, many people aruge that protection of wild animals and birds have received too much attention and resources. However, I disagree with this statment.

In my view, protection of wildlife  have not received a lot of attention and resources. Today, many people buy crafts that make from animal'bones, fur and feather, due to  lack of  awareness of protection of wildlife, which leads to the fact that a large number of wild animals and birds are killed. For example, people kiled wildlife for food. Another example that people are stripped animal's fur for clothes.

Compared to the past, due to improvement of attention of wildlife, many people have paid attention to wild animals and birds in some extent, which leads to decrease of the number of animal' death. However, its

作业：
主体段1：
发展城市建设
建设城市道路-可以使用更多的道路-减轻主干道交通负担-缓解交通压力
鼓励人们低碳出行
人们低碳出行-人们将由开车变为骑自行车或者步行-车流量变少-缓解交通压力
主体段2：
发展免费公共交通
发展免费公共交通-人们更愿意乘坐免费的交通工具-一定程度上减轻交通压力
公共交通相对不便或者对于追求舒适的乘客还是不选择公共交通-乘坐公共交通的人数不多-不能缓解交通压力
不在高峰期时，人们出行需求变低，不会产生交通阻塞，没有必要发展24小时的公共交通

Nowadays, many people aruge that providing free public transport  24 hours a day everyweek is the best measure to sovle trafiic jam problem in cities. However, in my view, I disagree with this statment.

In my opinion, providing free public transport can not solving traffic congestions. In the frist place, developing the road construction is better way than development of  free public transport. Due to developmemt of road in cities such as building more roads, widening the road, there are many roads to use. Therefore, main-road's stree could be relieved efficiently, which leads the fact that the number of traffic jam problem could be reduce. In the second place, the number of vehicle could be reduced in road because to encourage people select low carban transport such as cycling, jogging and walking, which contribute to the fact that the traffic congestions could be solved.

By contrast, traffic congestions could be resolved in a some extent becase of free traffic transport. However, due to more convenience and confort, many people prefer to selecting car rather than public transport. Therefore, less people take traffic transport, which leads to traffic jam problem could not be solved. And many people have less damand for going out at night, so it is uncessary that developing free traffic transport 24 hours day everyweek. As a result, the traffic jam problem could be resolved.
