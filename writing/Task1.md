## Task1 主体段-柱状图

### 思路

1. 审图：开头段，图表元素（小标题、纵轴、横轴、**注意数据含义及单位**）
2. 分组：目的是分段（主体段），先写首年最大的组
3. 趋势：对每个趋势（段）进行分析，阶段分析最好小于3个
    - 如何划分阶段？
        - 在大趋势中找小趋势，比如，先上升后下降
        - 幅度的变化，比如，先快后慢
        - **如果题目中趋势一致，则分组写，几个相似的数据一组**
4. 对比，数据的对比
    - 最值（最小、最大、首年、末年）
        - 最大：the largest/the biggest/the greatest
        - 最小：the smallest/the least
    - 极值（自己的最大值最小值）
        - 顶点：峰值
            reach/increase to a peak at 9 b 
            reach its maximum peak
            this number peaked at 90 in1999
            - 将状语从句转化为分词做伴随状语形式
                <u>After this number reached peak at 9 b, it dropped to 10.</u> = After reaching a peak at 9 b, this number dropped to 10.
        - 底点
            reach/fall to a bottom at 10 b.
    - 相似 be similar to/with
    - 相等 be equal to 
    - 超过（交点）overtake/exceed/surpass **有多个交点时，写最后一个交点，因为这个交点之后没有其他的交点，比较好描述**
5.  逻辑连接词（**如果没有把握使用正确，则不用**）
    - 对比：while, By contrast, In contrast, Compared with A,B...
    - 转折：however, but, on the other hand, on the contrary
    - 并列：and, also
    - 顺承：then, after that


### 标点符号的使用

**在英语中句号和逗号的使用方式与中文不同**

在英语中使用句号取决于句子成分是否完整，连接两个句子需要加连词，比如，and

### 数据的表达方式（重要）

1. 两个简单句并列
    The number of visitors to park was largest, and it was 7 mllion in 1981. **注意连词和标点符号的使用**
2. at+数据
    The number of visiors to park was the largest at 7 million in 1981.
3. with+数据
    The number of visiors to park was largest with 7 million in 1981.
4. ,which was+数据，非限定性定语从句（修饰前面的句子）
    The number of visitors to park was the largest,which was 7 million in 1981.
5. reaching+数据，现在分词做伴随状语（有点难）
    <u>The number of visitors</u> to 1 was the largest when <u>the number of visitors</u> to park reahed 7 million.
    两处划线主语重复可以改为
    The number of visitors to park was the largest,**reaching** 7 million in 1981.

    **需要复习语法**

6. 上升到 increase to
7. 从...到... from ...to...（中间可插入时间，from 2m in 1981 to 1.9m in 2001）

>The bar chart gives information about how many travelers had visited five tourist destinations in a European country and how this number had changed in two decades.
Central amusement park was the most attractive tourist spot with about 7 million people visiting in 1981. Though this figure dropped to 6 million in 1991, it rose back to 6.5 million a decade later. Another decrease could also be witnessed in the number of people visiting the Science Park. After reaching a peak at 3 million in 1991 from 2.5 million, the number reduced dramatically to only 2 million in 2001. Similarly, these twenty years also saw a quite slight fall in the figure for Central Zoo, with just 2 million of visitors going there, which made it the least attractive tourist spot for people.
By contrast, as for National Park, the quantity of visitors to that place showed an upward trend from 3 million to 4.5 million. A similar trend had been found in the number of travelers to the National Gallery. In 1981, there were only 2.5 million people choosing to visit that attraction. However, this figure almost doubled, attracting nearly 5 million people during this period.

### 流程图结尾段

总结总共几个步骤，大概循环多久

### 地图题结尾段

概括大概的变化

## 语法点补充

-  超过、相等或者比什么更多，这种比较语句只能跟同类的比较
    例如：The consumption of chicken overtook the consumption of lamb.
    中鸡肉的消耗量只能跟羊肉的消耗量比较，而不能The consumption of chicken overtook lamb.这样就变成鸡肉的消耗量与羊肉比较，存在语义错误
- The consumption of chicken overtook <u>the consumption</u> of lamb.可以简化为The consumption of chicken overtook <u>that</u> of lamb.that 代指the consumption.**that特指单数，those特指附属**
- 定语从句，The book that I bought  yesterday was written by XDF.中从句修饰主语book缺少宾语成分，完整：I bought book yesterday.从句book与主句book用一个
e.g. Beef that was comused accouting for 10%. 中从句缺少成分（主语）与主句公用beef
- 比较语句：
A比B多5%：A 5% more than B
A比B少5%：A 5% less zhan B
- despite+句子，although+句子，表让步
- in terms of = on the item of  = as for 就...而言
- 如果图中没有时间表，则看题目中是否有时间标志（从句中看），如果都没有则当一般现在时处理
- 饼状图中，主语和谓语的搭配，百分比时不能占据的
- then 表顺承（表示在哪之后），需要找到时间线，比如，A上升了40%,and then 上升50%
-
