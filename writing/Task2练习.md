### 范文

>The relative importance of natural talent and training is a frequent topic of discussion when people try to explain different levels of ability in, for example, sport, art or music.

>Obviously, education systems are based on the belief that all children can effectively be taught to acquire different skills, including those associated with sport, art or music. So from our own school experience, we can find plenty of evidence to support the view that a child can acquire these skills with continued teaching and guided practice.

>However, some people believe that innate talent is what differentiates a person who has been trained to play a sport or an instrument, from those who become good players. In other words, there is more to the skill than a learned technique, and this extra talent cannot be taught, no matter how good the teacher or how frequently a child practices.

>I personally think that some people do have talents that are probably inherited via their genes. Such talents can give individuals a facility for certain skills that allow them to excel, while more hard-working students never manage to reach a comparable level. But, as with all questions of nature versus nurture, they are not mutually exclusive. Good musicians or artists and exceptional sports stars have probably succeeded because of both good training and natural talent. Without the natural talent, continuous training would be neither attractive nor productive, and without the training, the child would not learn how to exploit and develop their talent.

>In conclusion, I agree that any child can be taught particular skills, but to be really good in areas such as music, art or sport, then some natural talent is required.

- 审题：
普遍认为一些人生来就有某方面的天分，比如在体育或是音乐方面；而另一些人没有。

- 写作思路：
本文需要讨论要成为出色的运动员或是音乐家，是天分依靠，还是靠后天的教育和训练才能做到。构思时，考生应该从两方面进行分析和论证，在此基础上得出自己的倾向。最简单的写法是文章分为四段：第一段引出话题，第二、三段分别讨论两个方面的观点和各自的理由，第四段提出自己的观点。更加复杂一点的写法是把自己的观点结合进第二、三段，也就是说，在讨论别人观点的时候就进行有倾向性的评价。

1. 可以提升学生的能力

Many school leavers select travelling or working rather than go to university. In my view, **~~I think~~^1^** experiencing a gap year before they go to college has more advantages on their study.

Gap year is good at development of student's ability. In travelling and working, students could address a kind of problems without parents' help. Meanwhile, students could associate with a **~~varity~~ variety^2^** of people such as their boss, officers, and strangers who have provided assistance, which lead to the fact that personal ability of student could be developed significantly. As the result, 

Experience is a quite important part of personality. People could be **~~involve~~ involved^3^** a **~~varity~~ variety^2^** of culture such as diet, local custom, and local language, which help student **~~broadern~~ broaden^2^** horizon, gain knowledge, and get hold of the social **~~develmopent~~ development^2^**. And these are not **~~tuaght taught~~^2^** in campus.

In travelling, students' stress can be released effectively. People's mood can relax in some extent, due to travelling **~~aroud~~ around^2^** the world. It is beneficial for mental and physical health. And Then, students will have a better performance in **~~thire~~ their^2^** further studies in university.

To sum up, there are many advantages **~~when~~ for^4^** students travelling or working instead of going to university directly.

## Gender 

![范文图片](./resource/13.jpg)

Recently, An increaseing number of women have full time jobs, which means that  they would have less time to do  household chores. So, many people suggest that both women and men should share the housework task equally. As far as  I am concerned, I disagree this statement.

The volume of housework denpends on familiy member's contribution to their families. To be specific, people who have less contribution especially aspect of economic should shoulder/undertake more household choress. For example, people who contributes more to their family could spend more time in getting more money rather than  doing housework at which they are not good.

Household chores should be divided accoding to  people's work time. Some work longer while others have flexible work time, which means that it is impossible to  divide their housework time equally . There are two different reasons. Firstly, people who spend more time in their jobs such as woker in factory always have less time in their house, so, they could not undertake more hoursehold choress. Secondly, what many people are good at is different. To be specific, most men suitable for heavy work and women are good at housework that needs care and patience.

Recently, more and more people enjoy a variety of sport, such as football, swimming and so on. Many people think that taking part in team sports is more beneficial. But others think it is beneficial to take part in individual sports. In the writing below, both views will be discussed and my opinion will be given.

**~~Many people think that~~^1^** Team sports is better than individual sports. Firstly, teamwork is quite important to many sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball and so on, which needs perfect collaboration between team. So, during the sport or match period, these sports not only needs teamwork but also could improve team spirit for every team members. Secondly, it is useful that improve people's communication skills. In a kind of team sports with others, a man must communicate with other members. And communication is vital to a sport especially a match. Every team member **~~have~~ has^2^** chance to communicate with each other, which could improve member's communication skills. In addition, both improving captain's leadership and developing team member's friendship could advance in sports which are played in teams.

**~~However, others think~~^1^** Individual sports is more beneficial. Individual sports **~~are no~~ do not^6^** number limit such as swimming and walking. So people could sport everytime without other team member. Besides, individual sports could improve our ability of solving problems. For example, people are usually **involved in^7^** a variety of problems such as injuries. **~~So, we must solve these problems alone.~~**

In my view, team sports is better than individual sports.
